# Terminal Config

To configure the terminal, we'll perform the following steps:

- download the zipped file (https://github.com/ricardodecarvalho/terminal-config/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Extract the zipped file
- move the directory `terminal-config-main` to your home directory and name it `.terminal-config` (there's a dot at the front)
- move the `bash_profile` file to your home directory and name it `.bash_profile` (there's a dot at the front)

If you already have a `.bash_profile` file in your home directory, transfer the content from the downloaded `bash_profile` to your existing `.bash_profile`
